# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model

This repository contains the implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model, designed for precise querying and context-aware response generation using advanced NLP techniques.

## Features

- **Knowledge Base Querying**: Enables accurate and efficient information retrieval across custom knowledge bases.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Utilizes **BERT** for embedding generation to enhance relevance-based retrieval.
- **Cosine Similarity Matching**: Matches user queries with the most relevant sentences in the knowledge base.
- **Google Gemini LLM**: Leverages Google’s **Gemini Large Language Model** for generating accurate, context-aware responses.

## Project Details

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Built a RAG model to enable precise querying across any knowledge base.
- **BERT Embeddings**: Used Hugging Face’s BERT transformer to create embeddings of sentences, facilitating relevance-based retrieval.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Applied cosine similarity to match queries with the most relevant sentences before passing them to Google’s Gemini LLM.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Generated accurate, context-aware responses by feeding top-matching results to the LLM for final output.

## How It Works

1. **Embedding Creation**:
   - Input sentences are converted into embeddings using Hugging Face’s **BERT** transformer.
2. **Relevance Matching**:
   - Employs **cosine similarity** to find the most relevant sentences corresponding to user queries.
3. **Response Generation**:
   - Passes top-matching results to Google’s Gemini LLM for generating final, precise answers.
